\title{Empirical Fluctuation Process}
\description{Computes an empirical fluctuation process according
to a specified method from the generalized fluctuation test
framework}
\usage{
efp(formula, type = <<see below>>, h = 0.15, dynamic = FALSE,
  rescale = TRUE, tol = 1e-7, data)}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{a symbolic describtion for the model to be tested.}
  \item{type}{specifies which type of fluctuation process will be
     computed. For details see below.}
  \item{h}{a numeric from interval (0,1) sepcifying the bandwidth. determins the
     size of the data window relative to sample size (for MOSUM and ME processes
     only).}
  \item{dynamic}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the lagged observations are included as
     a regressor.}
  \item{rescale}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the estimates will be standardized by
    the regressor matrix of the corresponding subsample according to Kuan & Chen
    (1994); if \code{FALSE} the whole regressor matrix will be used.
    (only if \code{type} is either \code{"fluctuation"} or \code{"ME"})}
  \item{tol}{tolerance when \code{solve} is used}
  \item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. By
     default the variables are taken from the environment which \code{efp} is
     called from.}
}

\details{If \code{type} is one of \code{"Rec-CUSUM"}, \code{"OLS-CUSUM"},
\code{"Rec-MOSUM"} or \code{"OLS-MOSUM"} the function \code{efp} will return a
one-dimensional empiricial process of sums of residuals. Either it will be based
on recursive residuals or on OLS residuals and the process will contain
CUmulative SUMs or MOving SUMs of residuals in a certain data window.
For the MOSUM and ME processes all estimations are done for the
observations in a moving data window, whose size is determined by \code{h} and
which is shifted over the whole sample.

If there is a single structural change point \eqn{t^*}, the standard CUSUM path starts
to depart from its mean 0 at \eqn{t^*}. The OLS-based CUSUM path will have its peak
around \eqn{t^*}. The MOSUM path should have a strong change at \eqn{t^*}.

If \code{type} is either \code{"fluctuation"} or \code{"ME"} a
\emph{k}-dimensional process will be returned, if \emph{k} is the number of
regressors in the model, as it is based on recursive OLS estimates of the
regression coefficients or moving OLS estimates respectively.

Both paths should have a peak around \eqn{t^*} if there is a single structural shift.
}

\value{\code{efp} returns an object of class \code{"efp"} which inherits
from the class \code{"ts"} or \code{"mts"} respectively, to which a string
with the \code{type} of the process, the number of regressors (\code{nreg}),
the bandwidth (\code{h}) and the function call {\code{call}) are added as
attributes. The function \code{\link{plot}} has a method to plot the empirical
fluctuation process; with \code{sctest} the corresponding test on structural
change can be performed.}
